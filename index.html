                        <p class="about-text">As an individual who feels passion for both computer science and the outdoors, nearly one year ago I found myself packing my belongings into a moving van and driving out to the one area in this country I knew that I could get a sizable quantity of both, the Puget Sound. These days most of my free time is spent learning different coding languages, designing web-sites, trail running, and hiking. Not to mention the occasional trip to the ice cream shop down the street.</p> 
                        <p class="about-text">The passion I feel for coding can be located near the enjoyment and satisfaction I feel from making something out of nothing. Be it HTML/CSS or Ruby on Rails, it is that particular process (simplistic or arduous) that draws me towards the explorations of such powerful programming languages. While some people would possibly find programming and backpacking to be about as complementary as wearing a coat in the Mojave desert, I find the dualities of my interests to be preferable. Being many things and thinking outside of the box feels fundemental to both my work and life.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">In the coming months I plan to apply to various coding boot-camps in the Seattle area in hopes  of accelerating my knowledge of web-development. Additionally, I would like to explore the Mt. Rainier area as well as the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
                        <p class="about-text">Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.</p>
